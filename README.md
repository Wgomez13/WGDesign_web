W&G Design website

This website is for a web and graphic design company


This is a made up business for a class project at codelouisville.
For this project there are some requirements.

*Your project includes at least 3 custom-written CSS selectors/rules in a .css file which are applied to your HTML elements

*Your project includes custom-written JavaScript including at least one JavaScript function (jQuery is fine as well) located in a .js file

*Your code has some comments noting major portions of your code

*Your project code is on your GitHub account in its own repository

*It must include a README file located at the top level directory of your project that includes a description of your project and - if necessary - any special instructions to run/view your project

*You are highly encouraged to include a front-end framework such as AJAX, jQuery, or Angular in your project as a demonstration of your ability to utilize these. However, this is not a requirement of a passing project.

*You are also highly encouraged to add some form of user interactivity to your project where something responds to an action the user performs. However, this is also not a requirement of passing.

*Have fun! Your project should be something you're proud of and that adequately demonstrates your base knowledge in the concepts you've learned.
